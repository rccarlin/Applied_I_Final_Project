Applied 1 Final Project

Note: This project is from Fall 2023. We were asked to incorporate learning from class (mainly linear regression and model selection) into a project of our choosing; I decided to study how a house's age affected its sale price (and if that effect changed according to the model used to predict the price). After cleaning the data as needed, I fit a simple linear regression model with year (or decade) built predicting the sale price, and then a multiple linear regression model with all variables. Figuring that not all variables were necessary for predicting price, I used stepwise AIC and BIC, as well as LASSO regression to see what variables seemed to be relevant for predicting sale price.
